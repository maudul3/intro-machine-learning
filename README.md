Programming assignments for introductory coursework in machine learning.

## Assignments:

`programming1.py`: development of a neural network with a single hidden layer used to classify digits in the MNIST dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)

`programming2.py`: development of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not spam. Supporting dataset is `spambase_data.csv` sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase.

`programming3-cmeans.py`: Implementation of Fuzzy C-Means algorithm applied to 2d data simulated from 3 gaussian distributions with considerable overlap. Supporting dataset is `cluster_dataset.txt`.

`programming3-kmeans.py`: Implementation of K-Means algorithm applied to 2d data simulated from 3 gaussian distributions with considerable overlap. Supporting dataset is `cluster_dataset.txt`.
